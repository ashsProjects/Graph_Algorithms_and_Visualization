# This is a template for working with undirected graphs. In the adjacency list below, you can change the name of the nodes to 
# anything. By default, they are A, B, C, and D. You can also add more to the end in the same format. To add edges, you can
# enter a it within the list for a vertex. Within this list should be the end node and the weight of that edge separated by a colon. 
# To add more outgoing edges from a vertex, use commas to separate them. Use # for comments as they will be ignored.
# Please delete unneeded, empty vertices that do not have any outgoing edges. As this is an undirected graph, repeated edges
# will be ignored and will only be shown once in the graph.
#
A: [B:10, C:5]#For example, this would be for a graph that has an edge from A to B of weight 10 and another to C of weight 5
B: []
C: []
D: []
