# This is a template for working with undirected graphs. In the adjacency list below, you can change the name of the nodes to 
# anything. By default, they are A, B, C, and D. You can also add more to the end in the same format. To add edges, you can
# enter a it within the list for a vertex. Within this list should be the end node and the weight of that edge separated by a colon. 
# To add more outgoing edges from a vertex, use commas to separate them. Use # for comments as they will be ignored.
# Please define empty vertices that do not have any outgoing edges too as not having them will produce incorrect results. 
# As this is an undirected graph, please add the ending vertex in both vertices. For example, if there is an edge from A to B,
# add B to A's list and A to B's list. They will be shown only one time in the graphs.
#
A: [B:10, C:5]
B: [A:10, D:3, E:1]
C: [A:5]
D: [B:3, E:2]
E: [D:2, B:1]
