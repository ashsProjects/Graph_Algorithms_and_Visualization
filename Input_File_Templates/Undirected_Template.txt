# This is a template for working with undirected graphs. In the adjacency list below, you can change the name of the nodes to 
# anything. By default, they are A, B, C, and D. You can also add more to the end in the same format. To add edges, you can
# enter a it within the list for a vertex. Within this list should be the end node and the weight of that edge separated by a colon. 
# To add more outgoing edges from a vertex, use commas to separate them. Use # for comments as they will be ignored.
# Please define empty vertices that do not have any outgoing edges too as not having them will produce incorrect results. 
# As this is an undirected graph, please add the ending vertex in both vertices. For example, if there is an edge from A to B,
# add B to A's list and A to B's list. They will be shown only one time in the graphs.

A: [B:8, H:4, G:11]
B: [A:8, C:7, E:4, I:2]
C: [B:7, D:9, E:7]
D: [C:9, E:10]
E: [B:4, C:7, D:10, F:2]
F: [E:2, I:6, G:1]
G: [A:11, F:1, I:7, H:8]
H: [A:4, G:8]
I: [B:2, F:6, G:7]
