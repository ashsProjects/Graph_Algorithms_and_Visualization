# This is a template for working with directed graphs. In the adjacency list below, you can change the name of the nodes to 
# anything. By default, they are A, B, C, and D. You can also add more to the end in the same format. To add edges, you can
# enter it within the list for a vertex. Within this list should be the end node and the weight of that edge separated by a colon. 
# To add more outgoing edges from a vertex, use commas to separate them. Use # for comments as they will be ignored.
# Please delete unneeded, empty vertices that do not have any outgoing edges.
#
a: [b:2]#For example, this would be for a graph that has an edge from A to B of weight 10 and another to C of weight 5
b: [a:5]
c: [a:1]
s: [c:7, b:2]
