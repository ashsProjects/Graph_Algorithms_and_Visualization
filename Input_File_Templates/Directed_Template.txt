# This is a template for working with directed graphs. In the adjacency list below, you can change the name of the nodes to 
# anything. By default, they are A, B, C, and D. You can also add more to the end in the same format. To add edges, you can
# enter it within the list for a vertex. Within this list should be the end node and the weight of that edge separated by a colon. 
# To add more outgoing edges from a vertex, use commas to separate them. Use # for comments as they will be ignored.
# Please define empty vertices that do not have any outgoing edges too as not having them will produce incorrect results.
# For example, this "a: [b:2]" would be for a graph that has an edge from A to B of weight 10 and another to C of weight 5.
#
A: [B:3, F:2]
B: [C:4, E:5]
C: [A:3, D:3]
D: [H:2]
E: [G:3]
F: [E:4]
G: []
H: [E:6, G:1]
I: [A:6]
