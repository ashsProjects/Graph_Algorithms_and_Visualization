# Graph_Algotihms_and_Visualization
This is a wokring graph visualization and algorithms program that produces outputs to common graph algorithms and images for certain graphs.
It uses the Graphviz library for C++ to generate graph images, but the other algorithms are implemented by me. The program will only compile
for Windows with C++ versions >= 17 because of the Windows Graphviz library used. You can use the same executable, Graph.exe, with the appropriate
flag for directed and undirected graph options. Before running the program, make sure to fill the adjacency list under "Input_File_Templates" for
either. This is detailed in the program as well. 

## Files
1. *Directed.cc* contains the implementation for all algorithms defined in the header
2. *Directed.h* contains the definitions for constructors, methods, and structs used by the Directed class
3. *Undirected.cc* contains the implementation for all algorithms defined in the header 
4. *Undirected.h* contains the definitions for constructors, methods, and structs used by the Undirected class
5. *Main.cc* contains the driver code needed to run the program; displays options,  prompts for user, and calls methods

## Folders
1. *Graph_PNGs* contains the graph outputs generated by the program and Graphviz as png files; they are named according to what kind of algorithm generated them
2. *Graphviz* contains .lib and .exe files needed to utilize Graphviz in the program; Win32-64 bit version
3. *Graphviz_Files* contains the file used by the program to call Graphviz and generate the graph
4. *Input_File_Templates* contains the templates used for both graphs; the program will read the adjacency list from this folder

## Compiling
Clone the repository using:
'''bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ashsProjects/Graph_Algorithms_and_Visulization.git
'''

Compile the program:
'''bash
$ g++ -o Graph.exe Main.cc Undirected.cc Directed.cc
'''

Run the program:
'''bash
$ ./Graph.exe //for help
$ ./Graph.exe -u //for undirected
$ ./Graph.exe -d //for directed
'''
